=====
Setup
=====
FRE-cli is conda-installable from the “noaa-gfdl” anaconda channel (https://anaconda.org/NOAA-GFDL/fre-cli)
and is deployed on GFDL systems as Environment Modules.

On GFDL systems
========================
If you are at GFDL (gaea, PP/AN, workstations), you may skip installation::

  module load fre/2025.01

  fre --help

Generic
=======================
If you are outside GFDL or are a FRE developer, install with conda. If you're at GFDL, bring conda into your PATH::

  module load miniforge

If you are outside GFDL, install the miniconda tool with the standard instructions (https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/miniconda-install/).

Once you have conda available, install the latest fre-cli from the NOAA-GFDL anaconda channel::

  conda create --name fre --channel noaa-gfdl --channel conda-forge fre-cli

To install a specific version::

  conda create --name fre-202501 --channel noaa-gfdl --channel conda-forge fre-cli::2025.01

and activate it::

  conda activate fre

  fre --help
