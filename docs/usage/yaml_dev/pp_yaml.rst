Post-Processing Yaml
----------
The post-processing yamls include information specific to experiments, such as directories to data and other scripts used, switches, and component information. The post-processing yaml can further define more ``fre_properties`` that may be experiment specific. If there are any repeated reusable variables, the ones set in this yaml will overwrite those set in the model yaml. This is discussed further in the "Postprocess FMS History Output" section.
